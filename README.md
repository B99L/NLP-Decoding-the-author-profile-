# NLP-An analysis of the writing styles and
topic preferences of three authors

This work analyzes the individual
writing styles and themes of Markus Brotschi,
Stefan HÃ¤ne and Oliver Meiler, three top authors from the
authors from the Swissdox@LiRI database.
We use modern NLP methods, including
including Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic
the topic recognition and statistical analysis
of their texts. By comparing the author
profiles, we emphasize the unique writing style
of each author and illustrate the diversity
in the German writing culture within the
Swiss media landscape
